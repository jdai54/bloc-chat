<!-- the ngRepeat directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item, and $index is set to the item index or key -->
<div ng-repeat="room in home.rooms">
  {{room.$value}}
</div>
