<!-- the ngRepeat directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item, and $index is set to the item index or key -->
<div class="chatroom-list" ng-repeat="room in home.rooms">
  {{ room.name }}
</div>
